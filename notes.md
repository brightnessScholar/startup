//This will be my notes file - 

Today I was working on my server and I was frustrated because my macbook wouldn't let me save my key pair to key access. I need to ask Professor about this!

Today I learned how to use git's push and pull affects. This was so helpful for me because I wasn't super familiar with git beforehand. I knew how to push from vscode to git but not how to pull back.
