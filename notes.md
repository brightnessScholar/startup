//This will be my notes file - 

Today I was working on my server and I was frustrated because my macbook wouldn't let me save my key pair to key access. I need to ask Professor about this!

Today I learned how to use git's push and pull affects. This was so helpful for me because I wasn't super familiar with git beforehand. I knew how to push from vscode to git but not how to pull back.


*** Writing HTML
<html lang = "en">
    <head>
        <title>FirstHTML</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        Hello World

        <p>Hello world</p>

        <img alt="beach">
        src="image link w = 600 & h = 300" />
    </body>
</html>

html files have a head and body
    head -> title -> first HTML

Link references
Absolute:
    <a href = "link">
Relative:
    <g href = "link" />
