Startup application for BYU CS 260

## Areabook for Rms
### Sales Pitch
A common problem among college students (especially fresh off the mission rms in provo) is the fact that we are used to a routine, set schedule. Throughout high school and on our missions, we followed the same schedule every day - wake up, get ready, go to school/study, meet with friends, wind down, and sleep. Contrast that set lifestyle with the chaos of college decision making: now everything is up in the air for college students. The first thing they turn to is their devices, and search for a helpful 'planner' type program that will help them structure their life. As a return missionary who used the coveted 'Areabook' missionary planner application myself, I was in search of something to help me manage my life after coming home as well. However, most planner applications nowadays cost money and are honestly just as inefficient as google calendar.

My startup will be focused around creating a website designed, with the input of return missionaries and fellow college students, to help the user build their schedule in a user friendly, cost efficient way. While this website will be catered mostly to college students, it will have an alternative options that apply to any age.
